'''
You work in an automated factory and your objective is to write the method that will dispatch the packages to the correct stack, according to their volume and mass.

A package is bulky if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or when one of its dimension is greater or equal than 150 cm.

A package is heavy when its mass is greater or equal than 20 kg.

You must dispatch the packages in the following stacks:

          STANDARD: standard packages (those which are not bulky nor heavy) can be handled normally.

          SPECIAL: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.

          REJECTED: packages that are both heavy and bulky are rejected.
